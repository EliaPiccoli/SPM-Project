### _Application project: Graph Search_
A graph is described by a set of nodes N (with an associated value) and a set of arcs (oriented pairs of nodes). The application should take a node value X, a starting node S and must return the number of occurrences in the graph of the input node X found in the graph during a bread first parallel search starting from the node S. The graph to be searched is assumed to be acyclic.
